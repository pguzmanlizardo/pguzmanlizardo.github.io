<span style="display:none;">Pablo Guzm√°n Lizardo</span>

I am a PhD Candidate in Political Economics at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. I also hold a B.A. Honours in Economics and a B.A. Honours in Political Science from McGill University. 

My research interests are located in the intersection of political economics, public economics and development economics. My current research focuses on the political economy of taxation, with a focus on how local governments in lower-income settings can improve their fiscal capacity. I implement an RCT to evaluate the effectiveness of different strategies to motivate tax compliance within the context of a property tax reform in Kenema, Sierra Leone. In another line of work, I evaluate the impact of militarized policing and security on crime in Dominican Republic.
