<span style="display:none;">Pablo Guzmán Lizardo</span>

I am a PhD Candidate in Political Economics at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. I also hold a B.A. Honours in Economics and a B.A. Honours in Political Science from McGill University. My research interests are located in the intersection of development economics, public economics, and political economy. Particularly, I care about how weak States in lower-income countries can successfully build their capacity to raise revenues and provide public services. My work is based in Sierra Leone, where a historically weak State is currently undergoing a country-wide property tax reform to increase its fiscal capacity.

I explore these topics in my current research project. Over 8 months of fieldwork in Kenema, Sierra Leone, my co-authors and I establish a collaboration with the local government, the city’s traditional authorities, and the city’s main religious organizations. Together, we design, implement, and experimentally evaluate two interventions aiming to increase compliance with the local property tax and thus, the State’s fiscal capacity. One of these interventions introduces a system of transparent and systematic tax enforcement against defaulters, including enforcement notices and a court system in collaboration with the city’s traditional authorities. The second intervention implements a public campaign in collaboration with the city’s main Muslim and Christian communities, where local religious authorities visited over 3000 properties to motivate owners to comply with the tax. I then evaluate the impact of these interventions using both administrative tax data and several waves of survey data collection.

Ultimately, this project involved more than 6000 property tax defaulters, over a third of all defaulters in the city. Through this kind of collaborations with government authorities and civil society, I embed experimental and survey research within city-wide policy interventions, both evaluating and informing policy implementation in real-time. In a secondary research agenda, I study the impact of militarized policing on crime, public opinion, and democratic institutions in Dominican Republic.
