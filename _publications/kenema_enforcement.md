We implement an RCT involving over 6000 property owners to evaluate different strategies to increase tax compliance amidst a broader property tax reform in Kenema, Sierra Leone. We collaborated with the Kenema City Council to introduce a system of communications and a tax court to increase the transparency and accountability of traditional tax enforcement procedures. We also collaborate with religious leaders to motivate tax compliance and provide a rationale for taxation. The experiment shows that receiving enforcement increased compliance by 53.4 p.p., while the sensitization treatment increases compliance by 4.9 p.p. Using a recentered-IV approach, we find evidence of spatial spillovers. Baseline and midline surveys show substantive increases in pro-tax attitudes among all property owners in the city and no evidence of a backlash effect from enforcement.
